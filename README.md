## About

**Portable Crafting Standalone** is a Quilt mod allowing you to use a crafting table from your inventory.

It's partially adapted from `portable-crafting` from [Charm](https://modrinth.com/mod/charm). 

Players with a crafting table in their inventory can use a hotkey (Default: `v`) to access the crafting menu at any time.

For those who prefer a GUI button, there is integration with [Inventory Tabs](https://modrinth.com/mod/inventory-tabs-updated) from 1.2.0 onwards - which we recommend.

This mod uses the vanilla game's crafting screen, so is naturally compatible with other modded interactions with crafting tables, such as [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) - which we also recommend.

## Further Info

I'm a modpack developer - not a mod developer! I just wanted this for my modpack and to get some experience in. 

If you want to port this mod, do it yourself!
